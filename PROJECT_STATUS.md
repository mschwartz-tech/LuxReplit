2. Billing System Implementation (Priority: High)
   - Payment processing integration
   - Invoice generation system
   - Payment history tracking
   - Subscription management
   - Expected completion: 2 weeks

3. Progress Tracking UI Enhancement (Priority: Medium)
   - Add data visualization components
   - Implement progress comparison charts
   - Create measurement tracking dashboard
   - Add export functionality
   - Expected completion: 1 week

- TypeScript configuration complete
- Drizzle ORM integrated

## Schema Status
### Completed Tables
- Users
- Members
- Progress tracking
- Class templates

- Start prototyping progress tracking visualization components

### Recent Progress (February 22, 2025)
- ‚úÖ Implemented proper database constraints for progress measurements
- ‚úÖ Fixed validation for weight and body fat percentage
- ‚úÖ Corrected strength metrics table structure
- ‚úÖ All progress tracking tests now passing

### Immediate Next Actions
1. Begin member management test implementation:
   - Set up test fixtures for member operations
   - Implement basic CRUD test cases
   - Add validation test suite

2. Start billing system planning:
   - Document payment gateway requirements
   - Design invoice data structure
   - Plan subscription lifecycle management

3. Initialize progress tracking UI enhancement:
   - Select visualization libraries
   - Create component wireframes
   - Plan data transformation layer
