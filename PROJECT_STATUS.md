   - Complete test environment setup
   - Implement comprehensive test suite for member CRUD operations
   - Add validation tests for member profiles
   - Test member-trainer relationship management
   - Verify membership type transitions
   - Expected completion: 1 week

3. Progress Tracking UI Enhancement (Priority: Medium)
   - Add data visualization components
   - Implement progress comparison charts
   - Create measurement tracking dashboard
   - Add export functionality
   - Expected completion: 1 week

## Next Steps (Detailed Timeline)
