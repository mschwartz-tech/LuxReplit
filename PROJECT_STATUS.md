## Current Focus
- Implementing and debugging class scheduling system tests
- Addressing LSP issues in test files
- Setting up test workflow

## Next Steps
1. Debug and fix class scheduling tests
   - Address LSP issues with status enum in class-scheduling.test.ts
   - Verify database operations in test environment
   - Implement proper test cleanup

2. Implement remaining schema components:
   - Class scheduling system completion
   - Attendance tracking
   - Equipment inventory management
   - Membership billing and invoicing
   - Notification preferences and history

3. API Implementation Required:
   - Member management endpoints
   - Progress tracking endpoints
   - Class scheduling endpoints
   - Billing and payment endpoints

4. Frontend Implementation Required:
   - Progress tracking visualizations
   - Class schedule calendar interface
   - Member attendance tracking
   - Billing and payment UI

## Known Issues
1. LSP Issues in test files:
   - Cannot find name 'beforeAll' in setup.ts
   - Cannot find name 'afterAll' in setup.ts
   - Type issues with status enum in class-scheduling.test.ts

2. Testing Infrastructure:
   - Need to set up proper test runner workflow
   - Database cleanup between tests needs verification

## Recent Changes
- Added Jest configuration
- Implemented initial class scheduling tests
- Created test setup file
- Added class scheduling test file

## Environment Setup
- PostgreSQL database available
- Node.js 20 environment
- TypeScript configuration complete
- Drizzle ORM integrated

## Schema Status
### Completed Tables
