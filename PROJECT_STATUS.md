## Immediate Action Items (Next 48 Hours)
1. Payment Form Enhancement:
   - Debug server response format issues
   - Fix amount field type conversion
   - Improve error message handling
   - Add request/response logging
   - Verify API endpoint compatibility

2. Testing Coverage:
   - Add API response format tests
   - Implement error handling tests
   - Add form submission tests
   - Test edge cases for amount validation

## Known Issues
1. Payment System (Critical):
   - Server returning invalid JSON response format
   - Amount field type conversion issues
   - Form submission errors not properly handled
   - API response parsing failing
   - Attempted Solutions:
     1. Added Accept header for JSON responses
     2. Modified amount field validation
     3. Updated error handling logic
     4. Improved response parsing
     5. Added debug logging
   - Next Attempts:
     1. Verify API endpoint response format
     2. Test direct API calls without form
     3. Implement strict type checking
     4. Add response transformation layer
     5. Consider implementing retry logic

2. Testing Infrastructure:
   - ✅ Database isolation working
   - ✅ Basic payment tests implemented
   - 🟡 Payment validation tests needed
   - 🟡 Error handling tests required
   - 🟡 API response format tests pending

## Recent Changes (Last 24 Hours)
- 🟡 Added Accept header for JSON responses
- 🟡 Modified amount field validation and type conversion
- 🟡 Updated error handling for API responses
- 🟡 Improved form submission data formatting
- ❌ Server response format issues persist
- ❌ Payment creation still failing
