## Relationships

### Core Authentication & User Management
- **Users â†” Roles**: One-to-many relationship between users and roles (admin, trainer, member)
- **Users â†” Sessions**: One-to-many relationship for user session management
- **Users â†” Auth_Tokens**: One-to-many relationship for 2FA and social login tokens (planned)

### Facility Management
- **Locations â†” Trainers/Members/Membership_Types/Memberships/Sessions/Classes/Member_Location_Access/Products**: One-to-many relationships tie entities to specific locations
- **Equipment â†” Locations**: One-to-many relationship for equipment inventory tracking (planned)
- **Maintenance_Logs â†” Equipment**: One-to-many relationship for equipment maintenance history (planned)

### Training & Progress Tracking
- **Trainers â†” Sessions/Classes/Trainer_Availability/Trainer_Members/Workout_Templates/Meal_Plans**: One trainer can have many sessions, classes, availability slots, assigned members, workout templates, and meal plans
- **Members â†” Memberships/Sessions/Class_Registrations/Class_Waitlist/Progress/Member_Location_Access/Trainer_Members/Member_Workouts/Member_Meal_Plans**: One member can have many memberships, sessions, class registrations, waitlist entries, progress records, location access entries, trainer assignments, workouts, and meal plans
- **AI_Recommendations â†” Members**: One-to-many relationship for personalized AI-driven workout and nutrition recommendations (planned)

### Financial Management
- **Membership_Types â†” Memberships**: One membership type can apply to many memberships
- **Payments â†” Memberships/Sessions/Classes/Products**: Payments can link to any of these entities, determined by `payment_type`
- **Invoices â†” Members**: One-to-many relationship for billing history
- **Subscriptions â†” Members**: One-to-many relationship for recurring payment management

### Progress & Analytics
- **Progress â†” Strength_Metrics**: One progress entry can have many strength metrics
- **Analytics_Data â†” Members/Classes/Trainers**: One-to-many relationships for performance tracking (planned)
- **AI_Insights â†” Progress**: One-to-many relationship for AI-driven progress analysis (planned)

## Views

### Scheduled_Blocks View
Checks for trainer scheduling conflicts across sessions and classes.

| Field           | Type        | Description                          | Logic Explanation                                                                 |
|-----------------|-------------|--------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `trainer_id`    | Integer     | Trainer identifier                   | Identifies the trainer involved in the block.                                    |
| `date`          | DateTime    | Date of the block                    | Specifies when the block occurs; aligns with `Sessions`/`Classes`.               |
| `start_time`    | Text        | Start time of the block              | Defines the start of the scheduled block; from `time` field.                     |
| `end_time`      | DateTime    | End time of the block                | Calculated as `start_time + duration`; ensures accurate overlap detection.       |
| `type`          | String      | Type of block ('session', 'class')   | Distinguishes between session and class blocks; aids conflict logic.             |
| `id`            | Integer     | ID of the session or class           | References the specific session/class; useful for debugging or updates.          |

- **Definition**: Combines non-canceled `Sessions` and `Classes` to show trainer time blocks.
- **Purpose**: Used in app logic to prevent overlapping schedules.
- **Sample SQL** (SQLite-compatible):
  ```sql
  CREATE VIEW Scheduled_Blocks AS
  SELECT trainer_id, date, time AS start_time,
         DATETIME(date, '+' || duration || ' minutes') AS end_time,
         'session' AS type, session_id AS id
  FROM Sessions WHERE status != 'canceled' AND deleted_at IS NULL
  UNION ALL
  SELECT trainer_id, date, time AS start_time,
         DATETIME(date, '+' || duration || ' minutes') AS end_time,
         'class' AS type, class_id AS id
  FROM Classes WHERE status != 'canceled';
  ```

### Member_Analytics View (Planned)
Will provide aggregated member performance metrics:

```sql
CREATE VIEW Member_Analytics AS
SELECT 
  m.id,
  m.name,
  COUNT(DISTINCT s.id) as total_sessions,
  COUNT(DISTINCT c.id) as total_classes,
  AVG(p.performance_score) as avg_performance,
  MAX(p.updated_at) as last_activity
FROM members m
LEFT JOIN sessions s ON m.id = s.member_id
LEFT JOIN class_registrations cr ON m.id = cr.member_id
LEFT JOIN classes c ON cr.class_id = c.id
LEFT JOIN progress p ON m.id = p.member_id
GROUP BY m.id, m.name;
```

### AI_Recommendations View (Planned)
Will provide personalized workout and nutrition recommendations:

```sql
CREATE VIEW AI_Recommendations AS
SELECT 
  m.id as member_id,
  m.name,
  p.fitness_goals,
  p.current_level,
  ai.workout_recommendation,
  ai.nutrition_plan,
  ai.updated_at
FROM members m
JOIN progress p ON m.id = p.member_id
JOIN ai_insights ai ON m.id = ai.member_id
WHERE ai.status = 'active';
```
