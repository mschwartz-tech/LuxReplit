The pricing model should calculate and display costs based on the following parameters:

Sessions per week: Options are 1, 2, 3, or 4 sessions.
Cost per session: A unique cost per session for each session frequency (e.g., 1 session/week might be $50, 2 sessions/week might be $45 per session, etc.), editable by the admin.
Bi-weekly price: Calculated as (cost per session × sessions per week × 2), with the result editable if the admin wants to override the default calculation.
Paid-in-full (PIF) price: A separate total price for the full package (e.g., a 12-week package), unique for each session frequency, and editable by the admin.
Session duration: Two options—30 minutes or 60 minutes—with all above prices (per session, bi-weekly, PIF) having separate values for each duration.
Requirements:

Create a clean, concise table or form on the admin dashboard to display and edit all pricing data.
Use a structure like this for clarity:
Columns: Sessions per Week | 30-min Cost per Session | 30-min Bi-weekly Price | 30-min PIF Price | 60-min Cost per Session | 60-min Bi-weekly Price | 60-min PIF Price
Rows: One for each session frequency (1, 2, 3, 4).
Ensure all fields are editable inputs (e.g., text or number fields) that update dynamically in the UI.
Store the pricing data in a persistent way (e.g., Replit database or JSON file) so changes save and reload on refresh.
Add basic validation: ensure prices are positive numbers and alert the admin if a field is left empty.
Keep the design responsive and user-friendly for the admin dashboard (e.g., clear labels, minimal clutter).

| 3             | $35                 | $210             | $1200      | $50                 | $300             | $1650      |
| 4             | $32                 | $256             | $1500      | $45                 | $360             | $2000      |
The admin can click into any cell to edit the value, and changes save automatically.
If possible, add a 'Reset to Default' button to revert to initial pricing values (you can use the example above as defaults).
Please implement this in the most optimized way for Replit, using HTML/CSS for the front-end layout and JavaScript (or your preferred language) for logic and data handling. Let me know if you need clarification!"
