I want you to implement the database schema for my LuxReplit gym management app based on the following Markdown schema file, which is aligned with my current progress at https://github.com/mschwartz-tech/LuxReplit. Your task is to create the database tables in a relational database (use SQLite for simplicity) in the correct order to avoid errors, ensuring all dependencies (e.g., foreign keys) are handled properly. After creating the tables, populate each with 2-3 sample rows to test the structure. Use a single Python script with SQL commands via the `sqlite3` library, and include comments explaining each step. Implement the tables in this exact order to ensure smooth execution: Users, Members, Trainers, Classes, Class Signups, Payments, Meal Plans, Workouts. Here’s the schema:

## Additional Notes
- **Order Rationale:** 
  - Start with `Users` (base table), then `Members` and `Trainers` (depend on `Users`), followed by `Classes` (depends on `Trainers`), `Class Signups` (depends on `Classes` and `Members`), `Payments` (depends on `Members`), and finally `Meal Plans` and `Workouts` (depend on `Members` and optionally `Trainers`).
- **SQLite Notes:** Use INTEGER for INT, TEXT for VARCHAR/JSON, REAL for DECIMAL, and TEXT with CHECK constraints for ENUMs.
- **Sample Data:** Ensure JSON in `plan_content` is valid (e.g., {"day_1": {"breakfast": "Oatmeal"}} for meal plans).
