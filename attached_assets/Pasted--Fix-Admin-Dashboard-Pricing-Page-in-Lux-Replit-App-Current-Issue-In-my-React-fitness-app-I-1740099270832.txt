# Fix Admin Dashboard Pricing Page in Lux Replit App

## Current Issue
In my React fitness app, I'm having an issue with the Admin Dashboard Pricing page. When I click the "Add New Gym" button, I can successfully add a gym, but after adding it, the gym doesn't stay populated on the pricing page. It seems like there's a state management or data persistence issue.

## Project Structure
This is a React fitness app using Firebase/Firestore for the backend. The relevant files are:
- `src/Screens/PricingDisplay.jsx` - Main pricing dashboard that should display gyms
- `src/Screens/AddGym.jsx` - Form for adding new gyms
- Any related Firebase configuration files

## Specific Problems to Solve
1. Fix the issue where newly added gyms don't appear on the pricing page after being added
2. Ensure state is properly updated after adding a new gym
3. Make sure the Firestore queries and data structure are correctly implemented
4. Add proper error handling for the add/fetch operations

## Specific Solutions to Implement
1. Review and fix the state management after adding a new gym:
   - Check how the state is being updated after a new gym is added
   - Ensure that the pricing page re-fetches data or updates its state when returning from the Add Gym page

2. Review and fix Firestore data flow:
   - Verify that data is being correctly saved to Firestore in the expected format
   - Ensure that the Pricing component is correctly querying and subscribing to Firestore updates

3. Implement proper navigation and refresh:
   - Add a state refresh mechanism when navigating back to the pricing page
   - Consider using React context or Redux for shared state if appropriate

4. Add better error handling:
   - Implement try/catch blocks around Firebase operations
   - Add user feedback for success/failure states

## Technical Requirements
- Keep the existing UI design and styles
- Maintain compatibility with the existing Firebase structure
- Focus on fixing the data persistence and state management issues without major architectural changes

## Additional Context
This is part of an admin dashboard where gym administrators can add and manage different gym locations and their pricing. The newly added gyms should immediately appear in the pricing list after they're added.
